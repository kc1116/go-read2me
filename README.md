# go-speak2me

These set of go packages utilize the power of [Google's translate API ](https://cloud.google.com/translate/) for language translation 
combined with the power of [Amazon AWS Polly API](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) for text to speech. Together these API's 
can be used to; enter some text --> translate that text --> 'speak' that translated text
