We now move on to consider forward and futures foreign currency contracts from the perspective of a US investor. The underlying asset is one unit of the foreign currency. We will therefore define the variable S0 as the current spot price in US dollars of one unit of the foreign currency and F0 as the forward or futures price in US dollars of one unit of the foreign currency. This is consistent with the way we have defined S0 and F0 for other assets underlying forward and futures contracts. However, as mentioned in Section 2.11, it does not necessarily correspond to the way spot and forward exchange rates are quoted. For major exchange rates other than the British pound, euro, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar, a spot or forward exchange rate is normally quoted as the number of units of the currency that are equivalent to one US dollar.
